There it is. Git shows the exact change I made in the file. But, if you look at the diff command, you might wonder what HEAD is doing there! Well, it is there for a purpose.

If you can recall, Git has an index between local repository and your working directory. So most of Git commands can either refer to index or the local repo. When you say HEAD in your Git command, it refers the local repo.
