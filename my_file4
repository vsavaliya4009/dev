This is 4th file 

When recording your own work, the contents of modified files in your working tree are
       temporarily stored to a staging area called the "index" with git add. A file can be
       reverted back, only in the index but not in the working tree, to that of the last commit
       with git reset HEAD -- <file>, which effectively reverts git add and prevents the changes
       to this file from participating in the next commit. After building the state to be
       committed incrementally with these commands, git commit (without any pathname parameter)
       is used to record what has been staged so far. This is the most basic form of the command.
